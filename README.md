### Storage

> [!WARNING]
> In heavy development!

This is a multi-script program for a storage system inspired by *Applied Energistics 2*s ME system.

#### Installation

1. Run `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nirokay/cc-tweaked/refs/heads/master/storage/update.lua`
  in your CC:Tweaked computer terminal.
  This will download a file called `update.lua`, which will be used to install all files.
2. Run `update.lua`, by typing either `./update.lua` or `update` in your terminal
3. Everything will be installed, all you need to do is to restart the computer.
